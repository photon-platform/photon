Commissioner since 2012

===

Joe was appointed to the Alsea Port Commission two years ago and elected for a four year term in November of 2015. Joe and his wife of thirty-seven years, Jannette Macpherson, live on Eckman Creek Road. Joe represents commercial fisheries and sport anglers and hunters at the Oregon Legislature. Joe’s goal on the Commission is for the Port of Alsea to remain both economically and environmentally sustainable. In his spare time, he maintains a large rhodendron garden and a small wooden dory and is out on the local rivers fishing.
