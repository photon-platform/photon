The Port District was formed in 1910 and includes the communities of Waldport, Yachats and Tidewater. The Port holds land in public trust throughout much of the Alsea estuary up to mean high tide, as surveyed in 1912.

Crabbing is among the best in the state, and the bay also offers excellent salmon fishing and clamming.   Public docks for crabbing, fishing, and moorage, a launch ramp, Robinson Park and picnic area, are among the facilities available in the Port area.  Many private marinas along the river provide similar services.

Alsea Bay and River have over 50,000 user days by boaters annually, according to BOATING IN OREGON, Results of the 1999 Triennial Survey, by the Oregon State Marine Board.

Annually, more than 5000 boats are launched from the Port’s launch ramp.  Boaters from 127 Oregon cities and at least ten other states use Port facilities. Virtually all of the boats using Alsea Bay and River are trailered, with the average length of the vessel between 14-18 feet overall.
